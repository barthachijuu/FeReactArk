# Immer

Immutable data structures can be deeply compared in no time. This allows us to
efficiently determine if our components need to rerender since we know if the
`props` changed or not!

Check out [Introducing Immer: Immutability the easy way](https://hackernoon.com/introducing-immer-immutability-the-easy-way-9d73d8f71cb3)
and/or [The Rise of Immer in React](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/09/12/the-rise-of-immer-in-react/)
for a good explanation of how Immer works and the more intricate benefits it provides.

## Usage

The basic idea behind Immer is that you will apply all your changes to a temporary
draftState, which is a proxy of the currentState. Once all your mutations are completed,
Immer will produce the nextState based on the mutations to the draft state. (See the
[official docs](https://github.com/mweststrate/immer) for more details.)

The Immer package exposes the `produce` function which we use in the following way inside our reducers:

```JS
import produce from 'immer';

import { actionTypes } from './actions/enhancers';

const ACTION_HANDLERS = {
  [actionTypes.STATUS_IDLE]: produce((draft) => {
    draft.status = 'idle';
  }),
  [actionTypes.STATUS_LOADING]: produce((draft) => {
    draft.status = 'loading';
  }),
  [actionTypes.STATUS_SUCCESS]: produce((draft) => {
    draft.status = 'success';
  }),
  [actionTypes.STATUS_FAILURE]: produce((draft) => {
    draft.status = 'failure';
  }),

// [â€¦]

const enhancers = (state = initialState, action) => {
  const handler = ACTION_HANDLERS[action.type];
  return handler ? handler(state, action) : state;
};

```

We use [`reselect`](./reselect.md) to efficiently cache our computed application
state.

```JS
const myDataSelector = (state) => state.myData;
const messageSelector = (state) => state.myData.message;

export default myDataSelector;
```
