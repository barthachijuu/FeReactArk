# FeReactArk

<div align="center"><strong>Start your new react project quickly and easily</strong></div>
<div align="center">A very scalable architecture, with the best new front-end technologies, all on a configurable, feature-rich and a focus on performance and best practices</div>

## Features

___

### Easily scaffolding

Create api, components, containers, routes, action, sagas and mock - and jest tests - right from the CLI!

### Instant feedback

With the HMR, all the JS/CSS/HTML changes are reflected instantaneously without refreshing the page. Preserve application state even when you update something in the underlying code!

### Next generation JavaScript

With the ES6 syntax, you can use template strings, object destructuring, arrow functions, JSX syntax and more.

### Next generation CSS

Write composable CSS that's co-located with your components for complete modularity. Unique generated class names keep the specificity low while eliminating style clashes. Ship only the styles that are on the page for the best performance.

### Standard routing creation

It's natural to want to add pages (e.g. `/contact`) to your application, and routing makes this possible.

### Offline-first

The next frontier in performant web apps: availability without a network connection from the instant your users load the app (if you choose to start without any API).

### Static code analysis

Focus on writing new features without worrying about formatting or code quality. With the right editor setup, your code will automatically be formatted and linted as you work.

```
<sub><i>Keywords: React.js, Redux, Hot Reloading, ESNext, Babel, react-router, Offline First, `styled-components`, redux-saga, eslint</i></sub>
```

But don't read too fast... there's more!

- The best test setup: Automatically generation the jest scaffolding test for our component, to have the best code quality and non-breaking changes.
- The fastest fonts: Say goodbye to vacant text.
- Stay fast: Profile your app's performance from the comfort of your command line!
- Catch problems: AppVeyor setup included by default, so your tests get run automatically on Windows and Unix.

- [Node](http://nodejs.org/download/) (version >= 8.0.x)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (version >= 1.3.x)

### Getting Started

___
Make sure you have Node 8.0.0 or above and Yarn 1.3.0 or above installed.

1. Clone the repo using `git clone git@github.com:barthachijuu/FeReactArk.git`
2. Move to the appropriate directory `cd FeReactArk`
3. Install dependencies and check to see it works. It is recommended that you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for deterministic installs, but `npm install` will work just as well `yarn setup --project=projectName`
4. At this point, you can launch `yarn start` and navigate on `http://localhost:4000` to see the project started

Now you're ready to enjoy with your new project

If you want a solid, battle-tested base to build your next product upon and have some experience with react, this is the perfect start for you.
